            The Barabari Project is a non-profit working to provide quality
            training and mentorship to candidates from low-income categories,
            rural backgrounds, underprivileged caste sections, and
            underrepresented gender backgrounds. We want to become a gateway for
            candidates who lack access to these opportunities, to up-skill
            themselves, get well paying jobs, and become self-sufficient to take
            ownership of their careers.
