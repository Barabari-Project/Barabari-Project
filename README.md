# Todo
Mentor \
So a mentor you would be able to make a life changing impact in the lives of the candidates.
You get to Mentor one candidate from the program with doubts related to IT sector job preparation for both service and product companies. This involves clearing doubts in CS topics like DSA and OOPs and providing general career advice
Tentatively takes 0 - 2 hours / week. You get to help an underprivileged candidate with their preparation for IT jobs and help them get employed in top tech companies
In case time is an issue, you can always join us as a Doubt Solver, or Training Content Curator


Candidate \
1. Candidates from non-general casts (SC / ST / OBCs)
2. Candidates from low-income families (EWS)
3. Candidates from underrepresented gender backgrounds
Join us to up-skill via mentorship from industry mentors, and get jobs in the Indian Tech Sector

Volunteers \
You can volunteer with us in this effort of leading change for people from unprivileged communities and helping them upskill to better job roles. You can join in the content team or operations and research team
